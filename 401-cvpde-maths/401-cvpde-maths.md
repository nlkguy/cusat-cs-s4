2. Evaluate real integrals using residue theorem.
3. Formation and solution of partial differential equation.
4. Determine solution of partial differential equation for vibrating string and heat conduction.

## Module I - Analytic function
- Cauchy-Riemann equation (Cartesian and polar)-Harmonic function-
construction of analytic function given real or imaginary parts- Conformal mapping of standard
elementary function and bilinear transformation.
## Module II - Cauchy’s integral theorem
- Cauchy’s integral formula and for derivatives-Taylor’s and Laurent’s
expansion (without proof) - Singularities-Residues-Cauchy’s Residues theorem- Contour
integration involving unit circle.
## Module III - P.D.E
Formation of partial differential equation eliminating arbitrary constants and function—Solution
of first order equation-four standard types- Lagrange’s equation—Linear homogeneous partial
differential equation with constant coefficient.
## Module IV - 1D Wave Equation
