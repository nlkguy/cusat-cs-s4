19-202-0406 DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Course Outcomes:
On completion of this course the student will be able to:
1. Outline the characteristics and features of database systems.
2. Represent the components and relations through an ER diagram and convert that to relational
model.
3. Familiarise with the storage structures, accessing methods and indexing techniques.
4. Formulate relational algebra queries according to user requirements.
5. Formulate efficient SQL query and refine it with procedures, cursors etc.
6. Improve the database design by applying normalisation techniques.
7. Familiarise with an SQL interface of a multi-user relational DBMS package to create, secure,
populate, maintain and query a database.
8. Discover the basic issues of transactions and concurrency control of them.
